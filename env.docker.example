# Copy this file to .env in the project root for Docker Compose to use

# MongoDB Root User Configuration
# These are used by docker-compose.yml to configure MongoDB
MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
MONGO_DB_NAME=hive_db

# Note: The backend service in docker-compose.yml will automatically construct
